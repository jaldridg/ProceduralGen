# procedural-gen
A GUI that generates and displays procedurally generated terrain using the diamond-square generation algorithm. It comes with a many features such as custom seeds, different map resolutions, island generation, and a realistic terrain option.

This project is in progress
 - Currently adding rivers/lakes to the terrain

## Motivation
I've played a lot of Minecraft and have always wanted to make my own procedurally generated worlds. 

## Building/Running
There's no dependencies required. Just put the .java files in a folder and run main() in `ProceduralGen.java`

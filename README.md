# procedural-gen
A GUI that generates and displays procedurally generated terrain using the diamond-square generation algorithm. It comes with a many features such as custom seeds, different map resolutions, island generation, and a realistic terrain option.

This project is mostly done but If I ever return here's some ideas of what I may add:
 - More types of maps, maybe a MountainMap?
 - Scrollable terrain, or maps too big to fit on the screen that can be dragged around
 - Biomes by procedurally generating temperature and moisture 
 - Rivers if I'm feeling really big-brain

## Motivation
I've played a lot of Minecraft and have always wanted to make my own procedurally generated worlds. 

## Building/Running
There's no dependencies required. Just put the 7 .java files in a folder and run main() in `ProceduralGen.java`

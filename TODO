
LAST TIME
- Using LinkedLists for the river but its complaining about type
- Writing the algo to find the lowest point when generating a river

IN PROGRESS
- Rivers using the AfterEffectsGenerator

TODO
- Clear the //TODOs in code
- Remove the normalization of height by simpily generating heights within range
- Use shorts for height to reduce memory and open up bitwise operations
- Sort the heights using some nlogn algo
    > Then, we can only generate rivers if there's a mountain in the first place since a lot of islands aren't very tall
- When rivers are stuck in a valley, generate a lake

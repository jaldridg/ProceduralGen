IN PROGRESS: RIVERS
- Problems
    > The program dies a horrible death when generating rivers with different resolutions (mostly smaller I think)
    > When changing the resolution, the river locations change, but the seed is the same so they shouldn't
- Next up
    > Most rivers don't flow to the ocean, which is not how rivers work - recursive solution?

TANGENT
- Tiles instead of a height array which holds height, water level, etc.

TODO
- Clear the //TODOs in code
- Make folders for the classes and structure the project instead of throwing everything in the same folder
- Remove the normalization of height by simpily generating heights within range
- Use shorts for height to reduce memory and open up bitwise operations
- Sort the heights using some nlogn algo
    > Then, we can only generate rivers if there's a mountain in the first place since a lot of islands aren't very tall
- More types of maps like a mountain map 
- Scrollable terrain, or maps too big to fit on the screen that can be dragged around
- Biomes by procedurally generating temperature and moisture
- Orthogonal rendering?!?!

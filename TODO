
LAST TIME: RIVERS
Working but with a few problems
- NullPointers are common when generating water which we catch (but they shouldn't happen in the first place)
- When changing the resolution, the river locations change, but it's the same map so they shouldn't in theory 
    
OTHER TODOs
- Make folders for the classes and structure the project instead of throwing everything in the same folder
- Let's have the map or aeg store its rivers and lakes
- Hashtables for storing a lakes points. That way, the lake's equals() method runs in constant time
- Remove the normalization of height by simpily generating heights within range
- Use shorts for height to reduce memory and open up bitwise operations
- More types of maps like a mountain map
- Scrollable terrain, or maps too big to fit on the screen that can be dragged around
- Biomes by procedurally generating temperature and moisture
- Orthogonal rendering?!?!
